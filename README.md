# AFL-Score-Calculator

This program is created as part of an assignment in Trimester 1 2025. 

It is a AFL score calculator that takes input from a user, gathering details about the teams playing, and calculating who is currently winning. The outputs are not dynamic, in the sense that the user must 
update the team stats as the game progresses. 

This program is written in C++ using the Splashkit library, along with the MSYS MINGW64 Terminal.
